# Shrink Map

## Tool to shrink the world/map size of the techage survival server

In order to prevent the size of the value (currently almost 50 GB) from growing unnecessarily, I installed the mapcleaner tool.

Mapcleaner deletes unused areas of the map. Since this is very computationally intensive, Mapcleaner is set to only process a thin slice of the world each night after the backup. It takes over 2 years for the complete card.
